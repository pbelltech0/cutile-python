This directory tracks release notes for the next cutile-python version. To
avoid merge conflicts, there is one file per "change", e.g. a pull request or a
feature branch.

To add a release note, write a short user-friendly description of the bugfix or
the feature and save it to a new `.md` file in this directory. Pick a unique
filename that is descriptive but not excessively long.

To ensure your commit passes the CI checks, please add a copyright header at
the top of the file, similarly to this README.md.

Before each release, the notes are manually edited, sorted and integrated into
`docs/source/release_notes.rst`. Then this directory is cleared, with the
exception of README.md.
